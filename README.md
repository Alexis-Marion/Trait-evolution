<p align="justify"> This repository's purpose is to give a means of replicability to the article "Sequential trait evolution did not drive deep-time diversification in sharks" but can be generalized to other similar data. All of the presented scripts are written in R language (R Core Team, 2022). If you plan to use any of these scripts, please cite "Marion et al., 2024". </p>
